## Description

This is a VS Code extension providing syntax highlighting for the assembly language 
in used in Go. It applies mostly to amd86/x86/x64, but colors most of the other 
architectures as well. 

### Disclaimer

This is far from a complete or even very good syntax highlighter, but I think
it covers a lot of the basics. It may improve over time.

### Install

This isn't on the vscode marketplace (maybe someday? maybe never?) so you'll have 
to install manually. This should be able to be done by simply cloning the repo into 
the folder where vscode keeps its extensions. On linux this is:

    /home/USERNAME/.vscode/extensions

The extension should then appear in your list of installed extensions, and you can 
press 'enable' to use it.
