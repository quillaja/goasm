## Description

This is a VS Code extension providing syntax highlighting for the assembly language 
in used in Go. It applies mostly to amd64/x86/x64, but colors most of the other 
architectures as well. 

### Disclaimer

This is far from a complete or even very good syntax highlighter, but I think
it covers a lot of the basics. It may improve over time.
